                    <h1>Low Code</h1>
                    <h3>For Medium and Large Businesses</h3>
                    <p>Larger businesses have more complex requirements and usually need integrations with various other systems. In many cases team members with formal IT training are needed.</p>
                    <h3>For Web Designers</h3>
                    <p>Coming soon...</p>
                    <h3>For Developers</h3>
                    <p>Over the years there were many visual tools that most developers don't enjoy

                        <sup data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="TODO add references">*</sup>, because even if you can get a PoC up and running fast, tweaking, refactoring and maintaining the system in the long run was a pain.

                    </p>
                    <p>But the tools we love and use everyday as productive developers are also visual tools with tons of buttons, menus, options: vscode, Eclipse,
                        IntelliJ/Webstorm, github/gitlab, JIRA, etc.</p>
                    <p>Why don't we developers hate these tools? Because IDEs just help us navigate and manage the existing layers in our technology stack, they don't try to create
                        a new abstraction layer over the many layers we already have.</p>
                    <p>FormulaDB Low Code Platform tries to offer the same non-intrusive, lovable, helpful IDE-like experience for developers while also providing a simpler "No Code"
                        experience for non-developers.</p>
                    <p>The "No Code" mode is less powerful, but it's powerful enough so that in most cases business people can satisfy their own requirements using a
                        higher level language: Tables, Formulas (computed columns, validations, rules), Pages. From this perspective, FormulaDB is a also a good communication tool
                        making business people and developers speak a common language which is powerful enough to implement a virtually unlimited number of use cases.</p>
                    <p>Developers will be the maintainers of the platform and formuladb language: tweak theme (CSS/HTML/JS), implement new components and themes to be used in
                        Pages, implement custom functions, provide support with Tables/Formulas/Pages, monitor the system for errors and/or performance issues.</p>
                    <p>Developers can also implement any custom integrations or advanced custom functionality using the Function as a Service (FaaS) paradigm and/or packaging any custom or legacy application as docker containers and deploy them inside FormulaDB platform.</p>
                    <h3>For DevOps Engineers</h3>
                    <p>Coming soon...</p>
                    <h3>For System Administrators</h3>
                    <p>Coming soon...</p>
                    <h3>For IT Managers</h3>
                    <p>Coming soon...</p>
